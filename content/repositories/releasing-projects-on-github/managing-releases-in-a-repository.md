## About release management

You can create new releases with release notes, @mentions of contributors, and links to binary files, as well as edit or delete existing releases.

{% ifversion fpt %}
You can also publish an action from a specific release in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. For more information, see "<a href="/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace" class="dotcom-only">Publishing an action in the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}</a>."

You can choose whether {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %} ({% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}) objects are included in the ZIP files and tarballs that {% data variables.product.product_name %} creates for each release. For more information, see "[Managing {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects in archives of your repository](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-git-lfs-objects-in-archives-of-your-repository)."

   You can then view your published or draft releases in the releases feed for your repository. For more information, see "[Viewing your repository's releases and tags](/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags)."

   {%- endif %}

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

1. To create a release, use the `gh release create` subcommand. Replace `tag` with the desired tag for the release.

   ```shell
   gh release create <em>tag</em>
   ```

2. Follow the interactive prompts. Alternatively, you can specify arguments to skip these prompts. For more information about possible arguments, see [the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_create). For example, this command creates a prerelease with the specified title and notes.

   ```shell
   gh release create v1.3.2 --title "v1.3.2 (beta)" --notes "this is a beta release" --prerelease
   ```
{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.2 or ghae-issue-4972 %}
If you @mention any {% data variables.product.product_name %} users in the notes, the published release on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} will include a **Contributors** section with an avatar list of all the mentioned users.
{% endif %}

{% endcli %}

## Editing a release

  ![Update a release](/assets/images/help/releases/update-release.png)

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}
