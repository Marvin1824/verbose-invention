## About automatically generated release notes

Automatically generated release notes provide an automated alternative to manually writing release notes for your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} releases. With automatically generated release notes, you can quickly generate an overview of the contents of a release. You can also customize your automated release notes, using labels to create custom categories to organize pull requests you want to include, and exclude certain labels and users from appearing in the output.

## Creating automatically generated release notes for a new release

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.releases %}
3. Click **Draft a new release**. ![Releases draft button](/assets/images/help/releases/draft_release_button.png)
4. {% ifversion fpt %}Click **Choose a tag** and type{% else %}Type{% endif %} a version number for your release. Alternatively, select an existing tag.
  {% ifversion fpt %}
  ![Enter a tag](/assets/images/help/releases/releases-tag-create.png)
5. If you are creating a new tag, click **Create new tag**. ![Confirm you want to create a new tag](/assets/images/help/releases/releases-tag-create-confirm.png)
  {% else %}
  ![Releases tagged version](/assets/images/enterprise/releases/releases-tag-version.png)
{% endif %}
6. If you have created a new tag, use the drop-down menu to select the branch that contains the project you want to release.
  {% ifversion fpt %}![Choose a branch](/assets/images/help/releases/releases-choose-branch.png)
  {% else %}![Releases tagged branch](/assets/images/enterprise/releases/releases-tag-branch.png)
  {% endif %}
7. To the top right of the description text box, click **Auto-generate release notes**. ![Auto-generate release notes](/assets/images/help/releases/auto-generate-release-notes.png)
8. Check the generated notes to ensure they include all (and only) the information you want to include.
9. Optionally, to include binary files such as compiled programs in your release, drag and drop or manually select files in the binaries box. ![Providing a DMG with the Release](/assets/images/help/releases/releases_adding_binary.gif)
10. To notify users that the release is not ready for production and may be unstable, select **This is a pre-release**. ![Checkbox to mark a release as prerelease](/assets/images/help/releases/prerelease_checkbox.png)
{%- ifversion fpt %}
11. Optionally, select **Create a discussion for this release**, then select the **Category** drop-down menu and click a category for the release discussion. ![Checkbox to create a release discussion and drop-down menu to choose a category](/assets/images/help/releases/create-release-discussion.png)
{%- endif %}
12. If you're ready to publicize your release, click **Publish release**. To work on the release later, click **Save draft**. ![Publish release and Draft release buttons](/assets/images/help/releases/release_buttons.png)


## Creating a template for automatically generated release notes

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.files.add-file %}
3. In the file name field, type `.github/release.yml` to create the `release.yml` file in the `.github` directory. ![Create new file](/assets/images/help/releases/release-yml.png)
4. In the file, specify the pull request labels and authors you want to exclude from this release. You can also create new categories and list the pull request labels to be included in each of them. For more information, see "[Managing labels](/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels)."
