By default, user-owned and organization-wide project boards are private and only visible to people with read, write, or admin permissions to the project board. {% ifversion ghae %}内部{% else %}公共{% endif %}项目板对具有项目板 URL 的{% ifversion ghae %}任何企业成员{% else %}任何人{% endif %}可见。 Repository-level project boards share the visibility of their repository. That is, a private repository will have a private board, and this visibility cannot be changed.
