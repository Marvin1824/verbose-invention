If you want a CVE identification number for the security vulnerability in your project, and don't already have one, you can request a CVE identification number from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} 通常在 72 小时内审核请求。 请求 CVE 识别码不会公开您的安全通告。 If your security advisory is eligible for a CVE, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will reserve a CVE identification number for your advisory. We'll then publish the CVE details after you make your security advisory public. Anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can request a CVE identification number.

If you already have a CVE you want to use, for example, if you use a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) other than {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, add the CVE to the security advisory form. 例如，如果您想要获得与计划在发布时间发送的其他通信一致的通告，则可能会发生这种情况。 {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} cannot assign CVEs to your project if it is covered by another CNA.
