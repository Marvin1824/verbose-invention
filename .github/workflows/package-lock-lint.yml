          #   The --package-lock-only argument will only update the
          #   package-lock.json, instead of checking node_modules and
          #   downloading dependencies.

          npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts

          # If the package.json (dependencies and devDependencies) is
          # in correct sync with package-lock.json running the above command
          # should *not* make an edit to the package-lock.json. I.e.
          # running `git status` should
          # say "nothing to commit, working tree clean".
