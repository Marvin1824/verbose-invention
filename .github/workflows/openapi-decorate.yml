name: OpenAPI generate decorated schema files

# **What it does**: On 'Update OpenAPI Descriptions' PRs opened by github-openapi-bot, this workflow runs the script to generate the decorated OpenAPI files and commit them to the PR.
# **Why we have it**: So we can consume OpenAPI changes, decorate them, and publish them to the REST API docs.
# **Who does it impact**: Anyone making OpenAPI changes in `github/github`, and wanting to get them published on the docs site.
