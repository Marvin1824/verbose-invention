{% note %}

**Note:** After the {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} trial period ends, you must set a spending limit before you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}. By default, your organization will have a {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} spending limit of $0, which prevents any codespaces from being created. To allow your users to create codespaces in your organization, set the limit to a value higher than $0.
